## Experience

1. Committer of [TEAMMATES](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates), which is an open source online tool used by 350,000 users among 100+ countries.

1. Contributor of [Kentico cloud-sdk-swift](https://github.com/Kentico/cloud-sdk-swift). which is a Swift library of [Kentico cloud service](https://www.kentico.com/) 

1. A desktop address book and event manager app with simple UI named [Planno](https://nus-cs2103-ay1718s1.github.io/addressbook-level4), which is the project of CS2103. 

1. An iOS game: [Bubble Mania](https://github.com/cs3217/2018-ps5-Adoby7) with GUI and game engine. This is a solo project of CS3217.

1. Two related iOS apps named for managing and ordering food. The seller app [(Ding! stall)](https://github.com/cs3217/2018-final-project-group03) is to manage the food that the seller provides. The customer app [(Ding!)](https://github.com/cs3217/2018-final-project-group03) is to order the food. This is the group project of CS3217.

1. Distributed database project to manage warehouse items. [Cassandra](https://github.com/kexiaowen/WholesaleSupplierDB) and [MongoDB](https://github.com/kexiaowen/CS4224-MongoDB) are both used.

## Competencies
- Java: Overall 6.5 KLoC among 3 projects.

    * An OSS project [TEAMMATES](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates). I mainly work on the backend development of consolidating to RESTFul API. Java = 3KLoC

    * CS2103T project [Planno](https://nus-cs2103-ay1718s1.github.io/addressbook-level4). This app uses simple UI design and is covered by JUnit test. Java = 2.5KLoC

    * Grades for Java programming modules: CS1020(A+) CS2010(A+) CS2103T(A+)

    * Other projects done in Java: The driver of distributed database project. About 1KLoC Java. (See the database section below)

- Swift: Overall 12 KLoC among 3 projects
    * [Kentico cloud-sdk-swift](https://github.com/Kentico/cloud-sdk-swift). I have contributed to this open source project with Swift = 1KLoC.

    * The game [Bubble Mania](https://github.com/cs3217/2018-ps5-Adoby7) with both UI and game engine. Swift = 7KLoC.
    
    * Food ordering app named [Ding!](https://github.com/cs3217/2018-final-project-group03) and [Ding! stall](https://github.com/cs3217/2018-final-project-group03). Swift = 4KLoC.

    * Improving the [book chapter of Swift](https://github.com/se-edu/learningresources/pull/115).
    
    * Grade for Swift programming module: CS3217(A).

-  Database:
    * Food ordering app named [Ding!](https://github.com/cs3217/2018-final-project-group03) and [Ding! stall](https://github.com/cs3217/2018-final-project-group03), which integrates Google Firebase. I also design its noSQL model.

    * School projects using [SQL](https://github.com/Adoby7/PetCare), [Cassandra](https://github.com/kexiaowen/WholesaleSupplierDB), and [MongoDB](https://github.com/kexiaowen/CS4224-MongoDB). The SQL project uses centralized database design. On the other hand, Cassandra and MongoDB, which are noSQL, use distributed database design.

    * Improving the [book chapter of SQL injection](https://github.com/se-edu/learningresources/pull/115).

    * Grades for database modules: CS2102(A+) CS3223(A+) CS4224(A+)
