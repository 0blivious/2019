## Competencies 

#### DevOps
- Worked on core server management and deployment while interning at a fintech startup, JewelPaymentech
    - Made use of Open Source Tools like [Zabbix](https://www.zabbix.com/) and [the ELK stack](https://www.elastic.co/elk-stack) to build a monitoring system for the company's production servers. Configured a real-time dashboard and an email alert system.

    - Configured TRAVIS CI to run headless selenium browser tests
- Core team member for the [Source Academy](https://sourceacademy.nus.edu.sg/) - a gamified system designed to teach programming language concepts to over 400 students. My responsiblities include:
    - Deploying the site onto AWS. The system was set-up with a load balancer, AWS Lambda services along with EC2 instances
    - Maintaining the tools used to efficiently handle the deployment - e.g. terraform and bash scripts
- Gave 2 lightning talks to a large audience on DevOps related topics: Ansible ([slides](https://github.com/nus-cs3281/2019/issues/20)) and the ELK Stack([slides](https://github.com/nus-cs3281/2019/issues/68)). 
- Wrote a [book chapter on Docker](https://se-education.org/learningresources/contents/docker/Docker.html) in SE-EDU, an open-source resource for Software Engineering related topics.

#### Javascript
- Selected to be a tutor for a group of 8 students for [CS1101S Programming Methodology](https://ivle.nus.edu.sg/V1/lms/public/view_moduleoutline.aspx?CourseID=88939D88-A031-4919-8F8E-15D02CA33D9B&ClickFrom=StuViewBtn), an introductory programming module taught in the Source (a superset of Javascipt). Attained a teaching feedback score of 4.8/5.0.
- Worked on several features related to the front-end for [Teammates](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates), an open-source application designed to streamline peer evaluation process for educational institutions. The front-end is written with Angular and uses Typescript (another superset of Javascript):
    - Refactored the profile picture upload feature and simplified user flow - [#9575](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/9575)
    - Improved the Instructor Student List Page - [#9668](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/9668)

#### Java
- Worked on the migration of Application Programming Interfaces(APIs) for the latest version of Teammates; changes were done primarily in the back-end (which is in Java). A few sample PRs:
    - Migrated `/student` to new APIs ([#9504](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/9504) / [#9488](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/9488)) and migrated `/instructor` ([#9443](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/9443)) to new APIs. Refactored the Action Layer logic and wrote JUnit tests for the new features
- Took a couple of Java modules in NUS:
    - CS2030 Programming Methodology (Grade: A) : A module focused covering the basics of Object Oriented Programming, lambdas, streams and promises in Java
    - CS2103T Software Engineering (Grade: A): For this module, Mmy team and I worked on an [application to handle efficient dispatch of food delivery](https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T16-3/main/). I wrote over 1K lines of Java code with notable features including an offline map service. Read more about it in my portfolio [here](https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T16-3/main/blob/master/docs/team/rrtheonlyone.adoc).
- Attained first Place in  Credit Suisse Code Sprint 2018 by building a Java Web Server using the Spring Framework. My team and I had to configure this server to solve a series of programming challenges.
