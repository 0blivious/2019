9 | Authored PR: [[#9561] Add jmeter-gradle-plugin #9589](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/9589) - This PR was aborted because we ended up using the JMeter Java API instead of the jmeter-gradle-plugin. As a side note, the content from this PR was further worked on in [#9561](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/9561/commits/e890f73b1fbcaea0440849a2e2a89f01b810fe1a), before the decision to switch to the JMeter API was made.
