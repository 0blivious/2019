There is a slack group for developers to ask for help or discuss improvements what improvements they want to add. Invitation is gained by submitting a PR.

There is a setup guide as well as some documentation located over at /wiki page.  This isn't explicitly referenced in the README file, so it can be missed if you aren't looking for it. It has pretty decent documentation and videos on how someone went through bug fixing.
