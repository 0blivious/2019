## Projects

* [NEAT-Tetris](https://github.com/FausticSun/NEAT-Tetris)
  * A neural network, using Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm, built to play Tetris. It managed to achieve 80k lines with an adversarial distribution (biased towards SZ and T Shapes). Built with Java.
* [PoxBrain](https://poxbrain.jch.ooo) [GitHub](https://github.com/ChooJeremy/PoxBrain)
  * A website with online search capabilities for the online game PoxNora. Accomplished a guided search to search for items that met as much of the input criteria as possible. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP.
* [GRPG](https://github.com/keythkatz/GRPG)
  * A top-down 2d game like Runescape, filled with skills, monsters, NPCs and multiple quests. Built in C++ with DirectX.
* [Competitive Elevator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ooo.jch.elevator)
  * A multiplayer game on Android where players compete as elevators attempting to ferry more passengers than their opponent within a 60 second time limit. Also supports a single player mode and skins for elevators. Built with C# in Unity.
* [Space Shooter](https://market.myo.com/app/55bb73efe4b0a3fcf96f69b3/space-shooter-for-stroke-patient)
  * A game designed to help the rehabilitation of stroke patients, through the use of the Myo armband. The Myo armband is strapped around the patient's wrist and detects movement through electrical currents. These movements are then used to control the player's ship. Built with C# in Unity.
* [The King's Hand](https://jch.ooo/#!7)
  * A 3-dimensional 1st person Archery simulation game, which throws the player into missions with ever increasing diffculty to assassinate targets, and then return to the evacuation zone to get away. Built in Game Maker.
* [Who Knows?](https://jch.ooo/#!6)
  * A game inspired from Wits and Wagers. This game is used in teaching sessions and camps in Ngee Ann Polytechnic. The game is focused around students answering questions, similar to [Kahoot](https://kahoot.it/), but players can also vote on what they think is the right answer, instead of having to give the right answer.
* [Little Strike](https://jch.ooo/#!5)
  * A 2d multiplayer shooter game built with a peer-to-peer connection for players to battle it out in an all-out brawl. The game was played for approximately an hour by the entire class during a presentation, holding up over 10 simultaenous connections and combat between 10 clients. Built in C#, using Windows Forms.

## Competencies

* **Java**
  * Contributed to [Teammates](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates), a open source project used worldwide to gather feedback through forms. Mostly used in universities to gather feedback from students on other students or professors. Some contributions: [#9539](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/9539), [#9512](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/9512), [#9485](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/9485).
  * Implemented full fledged functionality for user accounts into OASIS, a all-in-one app for companies to manage employees. [View more](https://cs2103-ay1819s1-f10-1.github.io/main/team/choojeremy.html)
  * I was a teaching assistant for CS2030, a module focused around teaching students the basics of OOP, lambdas, streams and promises (known as CompletableFuture) in Java.
  * Built a neural network, using Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm, to play Tetris. It managed to achieve 80k lines with an adversarial distribution (biased towards SZ and T Shapes). [View more](https://github.com/FausticSun/NEAT-Tetris)

* **Web**
  * Contributed to [Netrunner](https://github.com/mtgred/netrunner), a web game based on the card game Netrunner. Contributions: [#4013](https://github.com/mtgred/netrunner/pull/4013), [#4016](https://github.com/mtgred/netrunner/pull/4016), [#4022](https://github.com/mtgred/netrunner/pull/4022), [#4024](https://github.com/mtgred/netrunner/pull/4024). Issues created: [#4012](https://github.com/mtgred/netrunner/issues/4012)
  * Developed a [website with online search capabilities](https://poxbrain.jch.ooo/) for the online game PoxNora. Accomplished a guided search
to search for items that met as much of the input criteria as possible. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP. [View more](https://github.com/ChooJeremy/PoxBrain)
  * Built [Reddit, minified](https://jch.ooo/r/), a webpage that allowed users to browse Reddit, but use less data.
  * Developed a web rhythm game called [Star Pelt](https://jch.ooo/phaser/) that relied on the player pressing buttons as stars reached the center of the screen. The player can also choose to use their own sound tracks. Additionally, I created a [web page](https://jch.ooo/phaser/realtime) that would showcase how the game detected beats in the song to spawn the stars.
  * Built a web game based around firing bullets that follow a specific graph pattern to kill enemies. Intended for O-level students to play to familiarize themselves with how different constants affect the shape of the graph. Play it [here](https://jch.ooo/game/)
  * Visualized the career paths of students through the use of Sankey Diagrams in [d3.js](https://d3js.org/). Data was gathered through scraping LinkedIn (with permission!) to showcase the aggregated data of where students go after Polytechnic and Junior Colleges, the average pay of graduates after University, and morer.

* **Security**
  * Developed scripts to get training data for an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) built with neural network. Scripts included just getting the website traffic itself without attacking it, and performing the POODLE attack and gathering the traffic from it.
  * Found a XSS vulnerability in Blackboard Learn, an education portal by blackboard for students and teachers to share materials. The vulnerability allowed an attacker to set up a web page in the same domain, together with the SSL padlock icon, that can act as a phishing page.
  * Created a [small CTF on my website](https://jch.ooo/minictf/). It contains 4 easy challenges that tests the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
