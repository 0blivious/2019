### Experience
* Internship with Sea Group (May 2018 - July 2018), where I worked on search and recommendations for the company’s e-commerce application Shopee which serves over 80 million users. I designed and built a distributed scheduler to horizontally scale indexing tasks, and a backend service which offers corrections for misspelt queries.  I also integrated Jaeger (a distributed tracing library) into the team’s services to improve observability, and gave a presentation to encourage adoption of this tool amongst other teams.

* Internship with Carousell (May 2017 - April 2018), where I worked on Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) and web performance for company's online classifieds web application with over 16 million users. I implemented dynamic sitemap generation to improve search engine results, and single sign-on to facilitate shared user sessions across Carousell web services. I was also part of the initial team that built the Carousell Progressive Web App (PWA) focused on improving mobile web performance.

### Competencies
