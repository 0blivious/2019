**Observations about the project**

Exercism is an online platform designed to help you improve your coding skills through practice and mentorship. It provides you with thousands of exercises spread across numerous language tracks.
I decided on contributing to Exercism because of the number of language tracks that a developer can choose from. Since I am most comfortable with Java, I made pull requests to the [Java Learning Track](https://github.com/exercism/java).
One can find other languages like C++, Python, JavaScript and many more.

Exercism uses tools like [Exalysis](https://github.com/exercism/exalysis) that automatically run the tests on a solution and makes some helpful suggestions based on static analysis of the code for common errors and patterns.
They even have a [Command Line Tool](https://github.com/exercism/cli) for interacting with the [website](https://exercism.io/) from the local environment.

The project workflow is smooth in general. Mentors are always ready to help new developers during the initial stages. The exercism community is active and there is an online chat room too where mentors and developers can discuss their ideas.

**Key Takeaways from this Project**

**1** An important thing I learned while contributing was to not be reluctant in suggesting alternative ways for a particular implementation.
It is a good practice to discuss ideas with the mentors and eventually settle on the best path.

**2** Writing code that is readable to other developers is very important. In fact documentation in the form of comments should be minimal.

**Improvements for Exercism**

**1** The documentation for Exercism could be improved. Making use of architecture diagrams or perhaps other visual aids should be included to help new developers get used to the codebase.
**2** Perhaps the issues could be labelled to help newcomers. This practice is followed in TEAMMATES and can be a good addition to the Exercism project.

**Suggestions for TEAMMATES**

A practice that TEAMMATES could adopt from Exercism is to have a dedicated channel for new developers coming into the organization. This can really help in the onboarding process.
