[SoC Indoor Navigation](https://github.com/chelseyong/Android-App-AR-Map-Navigation) [May 2018] 
* An Android app that allows School of Computing (SoC) visitors to find their indoor location on the map
* Involved in creating the main frame of the app to give users a better user experience
* Also used Mapbox API to retrieve user's current location and map out the shortest route to the user's destination in the displayed map
* Used ARCore to render arrows onto the screen and guide the user by following the directions

[Task Management app](https://github.com/CS2113-AY1819S1-W13-3/main) [Sep 2018] 
* A desktop application targeted at helping students organize their workload by adding daily tasks into the list and setting milestones for big projects so that you can complete them on time
* Implemented the core feature of allowing tasks to be added and laid the foundation for other features to be built upon
* Managed releases (v1.1 to v1.4) as Project Lead
* Here is my [portfolio](https://cs2113-ay1819s1-w13-3.github.io/main/team/chelseyong.html)

Search-and-rescue teleoperating robot [Jan 2018] 
* A robot built using an Arduino, Raspberry Pi, magnetometer and a light detecting and ranging (LIDAR) sensor
* Intended to allow users to operate in a safe environment while executing missions like locating survivors trapped in disaster aftermaths
* With the help of the LIDAR sensor, the robot used Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithm to send localizaton data back to the user who uses this information to remotely control the robot through the environment
