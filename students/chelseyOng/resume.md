Search-and-rescue teleoperating robot [Jan 2018] 
* A robot built using an Arduino, Raspberry Pi, magnetometer and a light detecting and ranging (LIDAR) sensor
* Intended to allow users to operate in a safe environment while executing missions like locating survivors trapped in disaster aftermaths
* With the help of the LIDAR sensor, the robot used Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithm to send localization data back to the user who uses this information to remotely control the robot through the environment
