[RepoSense](https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense) [Jan 2019]
* A contribution analysis tool that monitors multiple Git repositories in a single dashboard which is being used by over 100+ repositories and 500+ students
* Created selective filtering of file extensions in the code view [#448](https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/pull/448)
* Revamped the sorting toolbar to have more options for users to sort ramp charts and compare users' contribution accordingly [#618](https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/pull/618)

[SoC Indoor Navigation](https://github.com/chelseyong/Android-App-AR-Map-Navigation) [May 2018] 
* An Android app that provides School of Computing (SoC) visitors an engaging experience in finding their indoor location on the map and guiding them to their destination in the building
* Involved in creating the main frame of the app to give users a better user experience
* Utilized Mapbox's API to retrieve user's current location and map out the shortest route to the user's destination in the displayed map using Dijkstra's algorithm
* Integrated ARCore into project to render arrows onto the screen and guide the user in following the directions

Legal Case Retrieval [Jan 2019]
* Built a legal search engine that is used to retrieve relevant documents which can provide useful information to lawyers who are reading up on past legal cases.
* Algorithms such as query expansion and pseudo relevant feedback, are also implemented to improve the number of relevant documents returned to the user.

[Task Management app](https://github.com/CS2113-AY1819S1-W13-3/main) [Sep 2018] 
* A desktop application targeted at helping students organize their workload by adding daily tasks into the list and setting milestones for big projects so that you can complete them on time
* Implemented the core feature of allowing tasks to be added and laid the foundation for other features to be built upon
* Managed releases (v1.1 to v1.4) as Project Lead
* Here is my [portfolio](https://cs2113-ay1819s1-w13-3.github.io/main/team/chelseyong.html)

Search-and-rescue teleoperating robot [Jan 2018] 
* Designed to allow users flexibility in operating in a safe environment while executing dangerous missions like locating survivors trapped in disaster aftermaths
* Built using an Arduino, Raspberry Pi, magnetometer and a light detecting and ranging (LIDAR) sensor
* With the help of the LIDAR sensor, the robot used Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithm to send localization data back to the user who uses this information to remotely control the robot through the environment
