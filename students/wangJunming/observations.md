**Observations:**

[Exercism](https://exercism.io/my/tracks) is an online interactive tool for learning new programming languages. It supports more than 40 programming languages. Each language has its own exercise repo, which contains a set of exercises to improve your skills. Each language repo is maintained by some senior developers(all volunteers), who is in charge of maintaining, updating and reviewing new PRs. 

Overall, the project's documentation is well-written. They have general documentation about how to get started to contribute, which can be found [here](https://github.com/exercism/docs/tree/master/contributing-to-language-tracks). This is because although those repos differ from language to language, the general workflow of contributing is almost the same. It preserves the consistency across different repos. And make it much easier to contribute across different language repos. Apart from that, different repos also have their own supplementary documentation, which includes more detailed guidance and specification to help newcomers to get started. They have also created a separate repo named [problem-specifications](https://github.com/exercism/problem-specifications), it includes all the information about the exercises you can implement. In addition, exercism has kindly developed a tool [configlet](https://github.com/exercism/configlet), which is an integrated tool that could generate templates, lint, upgrading etc. It automates all the tedious works and let developers focus more on the development. However, unlike TEAMMATES, they never use any graphics in their documentation, I think including some proper diagrams will make newcomers to understand the project structure more easily. Lastly, when I worked across different language repos, I found their labels for issues are inconsistent across different repos. Each repo has its own set of labels for issues, and some times similar labels can mean different things in different repos. 

The contribution workflow is similar to TEAMMATES as can be found [here](https://github.com/exercism/docs/blob/master/you-can-help/implement-an-exercise-from-specification.md). One thing I liked about exercism is that they have strict regulations about commit messages, they have even kindly included some article of [how to write good commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules), I really enjoyed those articles and learned a lot from it. Recall when I was working on my [first task](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/9436) of TEAMMATES on API consolidation, the commit messages are just a mess. However, I gradually learned how to organize the message after reading those articles. Organizing commit messages not only make the reviewer's life easier, but also shorten the review process since everything becomes clearer.

One thing I observed is that many large-scale open source projects(not only exercism) tend to make their project easy to get started for newcomers. Either by writing high-quality documentation, provide a tool for automating tedious work or label some first-timer issue. All those encourages for contributing. Although TEAMMATES has well-written documentation and labeled first-timers issue properly, I notice it does not have many volunteered contributors. One key reason might be its relatively complicated local set up instruction(although is well written). Nowadays many projects are migrating to [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), which makes local set up as easy as one command. Should TEAMMATES apply docker also?
