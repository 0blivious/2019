## Experience and Notable Projects

#### MrJudge <small class="text-muted">Developer</small>
_2017 - Present_

[MrJudge](https://dunjudge.me) is an online judge developed for training competitive programming, used by over 1,500 trainers and students.
As one of the core developers, I developed the reliability monitoring component to automatically monitor, alert and failover in case of system failure.

#### National University of Singapore <small class="text-muted">Teaching Assistant</small>
_2017 - Present_

Gained experience as a Teaching Assistant for the following courses:
- CS2040: <trigger for="modal:2040" trigger="click">Data Structure and Algorithms</trigger> (4 iterations)
- CS2030: <trigger for="modal:2030" trigger="click">Programming Methodology II</trigger> (1 iteration)
- CS1010: <trigger for="modal:1010" trigger="click">Programming Methodology I</trigger> (1 iteration)

Placed on the Honour List of Student Tutors for teaching excellence.

#### TinkerTanker <small class="text-muted">Intern / Freelance Trainer</small>
_2016 - Present_
Developed the GetHacking iOS app, a digital maker project in collaboration with IMDA Singapore. The one-stop app contains tools to allow anyone to program a micro:bit from scratch. I also worked on some hardware projects, including a real -life Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes clone, built with Arduino and Raspberry Pi.
After the internship, I stayed on as a freelance trainer to teach programming.

## Competencies

#### NodeJS
NodeJS is my go-to language for writing server-side software. With its vast npm collection, NodeJS allows me to quickly prototype software projects.
Among many projects, I implemented the Reliability Monitoring service from MrJudge, as well as a live code sharing tool that enables teachers to
cast code in real time to students during a lecture.
Some snippets of my code can be found at [here](https://gist.github.com/sijie123/26be19e7aba1522b79cef42b75bfed89)

#### Java
Having learnt the intricacies of the Java language through a module in NUS, CS2030: Programming Methodology II, 
I furthered my interest in the language by returning as a Teaching Assistant in the next semester.
Following which, I developed a Software Engineering project in Java. Coming in at ~10kLoC, 
the Software Engineering project, <trigger for="modal:dm" trigger="click">DeadlineManager</trigger>, allowed me to use various styles of programming (e.g. Functional / OOP) in Java to develop a robust and clean product.
My project portfolio can be found [here](https://cs2103-ay1819s1-w17-4.github.io/main/team/sijie123.html).
<br/>
<br/>
I received A and A+ respectively for the two modules.

#### Competitive Programming
To further my capabilities of writing accurate and efficient code, I have trained for and participated in various competitive programming competitions, 
such as the [National Olympiad in Informatics](https://noisg.comp.nus.edu.sg) and [Inter-Collegiate Programming Competition](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~acmicpc/).
Most recently, I was one of the teams that represented NUS in the Singapore ICPC Regionals. My team attained a first-to-solve prize in the competition.
<br/>
<br/>
To advance my knowledge in Algorithms, I have also challenged myself as a Teaching Assistant for CS2040: Data Structures and Algorithms.
<br/>
<br/>
I am also part of the organising team for the National Olympiad in Informatics 2019/20.

    <h4>CS2040</h4>
  </div>
  <p>This module introduces students to the design and implementation of fundamental data structures and algorithms. 
The module covers basic data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, binary heaps, trees, and graphs), 
searching and sorting algorithms, and basic analysis of algorithms.<br/>Source: NUSMods</p>

  <h4>CS2030</h4>
  </div>
  <p>This module is a follow up to CS1010. It explores two modern programming paradigms, object-oriented programming 
and functional programming. Through a series of integrated assignments, students will learn to develop medium-scale 
software programs in the order of thousands of lines of code and tens of classes using objectoriented design principles 
and advanced programming constructs available in the two paradigms. Topics include objects and classes, composition, 
association, inheritance, interface, polymorphism, abstract classes, dynamic binding, lambda expression, effect-free programming, 
first class functions, closures, continuations, monad, etc.<br/>Source: NUSMods</p>

    <h4>CS1010</h4>
  </div>
  <p>This module introduces the fundamental concepts of problem solving by computing and programming using an imperative programming language.
 It is the first and foremost introductory course to computing. Topics covered include computational thinking and computational problem solving, 
 designing and specifying an algorithm, basic problem formulation and problem solving approaches, program development, coding, testing and debugging, 
 fundamental programming constructs (variables, types, expressions, assignments, functions, control structures, etc.), fundamental data structures 
 (arrays, strings, composite data types), basic sorting, and recursion.<br/>Source: NUSMods</p>
